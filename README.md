#FAQs :gem:

1. How to prepare for the quiz?

Read the slides and references thoroughly. Quiz will be MCQ based.

2. What will come in the exam?

The contents of slides and provided references and code files are sufficient to prepare for the exam. If you are clever, you will search google for "HTML exam questions" etc. to get an idea. I would like to have an MCQ based exam.
